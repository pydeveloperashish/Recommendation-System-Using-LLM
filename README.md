Hello, This is the POC of Recommendation system for product suggestions check this out:- https://recommendation-system-using-llm-56x3wzj2dneosholurmqit.streamlit.app/

give this query:- I want to get an ecommerce website in shopify to sell pet food. Suggest a product i can use and customise for it

and once you click on get_recommondation, it will show you Recommendations..and it will ask you if you are satisfied with its suggsestions, if you say yes then it will say thankyou and will restart the app, if you say no then it will change its recommendations.. 
It remembers past output. But ya i have only 20 number of rows so it will re-recommend you 2-3 times only
